# Weather App

This week was a solo project of creating a weather app fetching API. We were to use branches for different features in the project. I chose to create my own design, inspired by the base of the 2 design available, since I really enjoy playing around with ideas. 

## The problem

I started off by working on the fetch and solving the output of the data from the API. I worked on the design last, since I found that the javascript is the most challenging. I managed to add a searchbar to find any city that is registered in the API. I was stuggling a bit with the change of the forecast into the correct days, since the first array often was the same day (before 12) and didn't belong in the forecast. The main issue was that I didn't even notice, for days. It taught me to scan through the results a bit more thorougly. I was short in time because of VAB and didn't manage to finish the stretchgoal of users location. I will look into adding this when I have the time.
