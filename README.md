# Weather App

This week was a solo project of creating a weather app fetching API. We were to use branches for different features in the project. I chose to create my own design, inspired by the base of the 2 design available, since I really enjoy playing around with ideas. 

## The problem

I started off by working on the fetch and solving the output of the data from the API. I worked on the design last, since I found that the javascript is the most challenging. I was stuggling with the change of the forecast into 4 days where the first array was removed, since it often was the same day (before 12) and didn't belong in the forecast. But after 12, you would then jump one day too far and skip tomorrows forecast. I haven't found a way to solve this.
